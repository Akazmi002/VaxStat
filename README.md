# VaxStat
## Inspiration
As people itch to travel during the Coronavirus, we wanted to make an app that can help them better make decisions on the safest places to go. 

We took into account that Corona Cases, in specific are not the best way to track if a place is safe to go or not, because low cases do not equate to low risk, as many people could still be asymptomatic and spread the virus without a trace.


After doing careful research, we decided the best way to see how safe a place is, is to see how much of the population is vaccinated against the Coronavirus. For the safety of both you as the tourist, and the people at the place you are visiting. 

We could not find another API or App that offered this data, so we decided to make our own :) 




## What it does
Displays how vaccinated a certain location is from the COVID-19, as an indicator of how safe the place is to visit!

## How I built it
VaxStat is built on a Django Rest Framework that uses Flutter as its frontend, as well as Google Firebase and GCP! It is powered by official data from each county in the United States. Along with the strong credibility of our data, we also are updating our data every day to ensure reliability. 

## Challenges I ran into
We had a harder time using Flutter as the frontend, as it was our first time. But we believe we solved our issues well and made an awesome project!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Getting done with the whole project in a very limited time!

## What I learned
We learned how to work together as a team, but also how to make full-stack applications more efficient 

## What's next for VaxStat 
We want to have a public API, so more people and creators can access our data that we have scraped from all 50 states!
